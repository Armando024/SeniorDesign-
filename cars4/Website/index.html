            This page is dedicated to our Senior Project, Cars4. Using maching learning more specifically, reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is about how the maching optimizes its choices to make its way to some kind of award. In this project, the award is to get to the end point. For this simulation, Neural Networking was used to help the car decide which direction to go. Reinforcment learning was used move out of dead ends. With these combined methods, we are able to simulate a self learnign vehicle. This website shows how our machine learns and showcases the trials it takes to reach the end.
