1 . In Huffman encoding algorithm (sort the symbols in order and merge the 
top two symbols iteratively until only one node is left),
prove that for two symbols A and B with probabilities p(A) >= p(B), 
then the resultant sequence according to Huffman encoding procedure, the length of symbol A is
no longer than that of symbol B. 



2. Apply double-blind testing method to compare the performance of any two search engines
(either image search or content search) or 
translators that you are free to choose.  

Def: 
Performance: 
            Amount of search results.
